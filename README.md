# Vocabulary Backend

> This repository includes the Django project files for the Sanasto app and the build version of the frontend. The frontend source code is in a separate repository in https://github.com/atoivanen/vocabulary-frontend.

## About Sanasto

Sanasto is a web app that helps learning a foreing language. It automatically builds vocabularies from given texts. The current version uses [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) to lemmatize French and Italian texts and [FreeDict's](https://freedict.org/) French-Finnish, French-English, and Italian-Finnish dictionaries to build vocabularies. 

The app has been made as part of the Full Stack Open course of the University of Helsinki. It is not actively developed or maintained.

## Demo

A demo version with limited functionality is running on a hobby server at http://sanasto.herokuapp.com. SpaCy cannot be run on the server because of too little memory. Database is limited to 10 000 rows.
